# Complete Website Project: GM Veículos
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/react)](https://github.com/Dom-Luiz-III/JM_Veiculos/blob/main/LICENSE) 

---
## Description:
Built on top of the previous project, Concessionaria_Website, GM Veículos represents a second stage of development. This phase of the project underwent a detailed group evaluation, under the guidance of Professor Ivanilldo at SENAI, which required the incorporation of new requirements and functionalities.

In addition to expanding and enhancing what was done in Concessionaria_Website, GM Veículos now plays a key role in system testing and meeting additional requirements set by Professor Yanes in the Systems Testing subject. This evolution aims to meet the growing needs and increasingly high expectations of the academic and professional environment.
